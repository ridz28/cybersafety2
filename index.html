<h1>Strong Passwords</h1>

<p>When you create a passsword you should always make sure that the password is a strong password. A weak password is a password
     that is simple and easy to guess. For example, 12345 or Ridhi (your name) or a password with only letters or numbers.
      A strong password is a password with numbers, symbols and letters that are not obvious. For example, if your dog's name is Sweety, and you want to make that 
    your password, you could change it to $w€€t¥*1. This way the password is harder to guess and hackers can't get it as easily.</p>
